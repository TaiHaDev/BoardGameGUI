Component: applyAction function, and bug fixing.

### Comments 

The code is well documented--generally clear what the purpose is; then when it isn't, comments were provided--and
uses a functional style (through the Streams API) to write nontrivial code in a natural, readable way. The code 
also implements the apply methods for each action, using interfaces, thus keeping appropriate class structure, 
and sticks to the style guide throughout (camel case for method names, etc.).
